![screenshot](./book-search-screenshot.png)

## Project Description

This project refactors a Google Books API search engine from a RESTful API to a GraphQL API with Apollo Server. The search engine is built using the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. A user can create an account, search for books, and save them to a list. On a separately rendered page, the user can see their saved books and remove books from the list.
